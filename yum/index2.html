        <li>Wash the spinach and remove the stems only if they are thick and hard.</li>

        <li>Put the leaves in a large pan, cover with a lid, and set over low heat until the leaves crumple into a soft mass. They will steam in the water that clings to them in 1-2 minutes. Drain well.</li>

        <li>Heat the garlic in 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan until the aroma arises.</li>

        <li>Add the chopped preserved lemon peel, the chopped olives and the cooked spinach. Season with salt and pepper, mix well, and cook over high heat for a moment or two.</li>

        <li>Stir in the remaining oil, garnish with the reserved olives, and serve cold.</li>
